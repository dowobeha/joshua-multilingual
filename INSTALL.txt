| Getting the Joshua Decoder |
 ----------------------------

The best way to obtain a copy of the Joshua source code is to check
out from the main SVN repository. For this, you need Subversion, which
is likely already present on your system. If not, if can be obtained
freely at http://subversion.tigris.org/. If you already have a copy of
Joshua, please skip to the Prerequisites or Installing & Compiling
sections of this document.

To set up your own copy of Joshua, you start by checking out the main
development branch:

$ svn co https://joshua.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/joshua/trunk joshua

This creates a subdirectory with your local copy of the source
code. This directory is under version control, which means that your
local copy is tied to the main repository. This facilitates keeping
your code up-to-date as well as contributing your changes back to the
repository.

To fetch the latest changes, fixes or improvements to the decoder, you
simply run:

$ cd joshua
$ svn up

A more detailed introduction on SVN can be found at
http://subversion.tigris.org/.



 ---------------
| Prerequisites |
 ---------------

[ Java ]

Joshua is written in Java, and thus requires a Java SDK to be
installed. Please make sure you use a recent version of Java. Make
sure you have $JAVA_HOME set to the SDK directory.

For Mac OS X this usually is done by adding

export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/Home"

to your .bashrc, .bash_profile or .profile file.


[ Build Tools ]

For building as well as for the actual decoding, Joshua also requires
a few additional software packages:

- Apache Ant -
is a Java building tool with functionality similar to the
make tool. It can be found at 
      http://ant.apache.org/

- Swig - 
is an inter-language wrapper and can be obtained at 
      http://www.swig.org/

- SRILM - 
is a widely used language modeling toolkit, available for
download at 
      http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/

Make sure you have the $SRILM variable set to the directory you
installed SRILM in, i.e.

$ export SRILM=/path/to/srilm



 -------------------------------
| Installing & Compiling Joshua |
 -------------------------------

First of all, make sure Ant and Swig are installed and properly set up
(i.e. accessible from the command line). SRILM should be build prior
to this step. For convenience, you may wish to set the JOSHUA_HOME 
environment to the directory you installed Joshua in.

To build Joshua, it is sufficient to change into its install directory
and run make:

$ cd $JOSHUA_HOME
$ ant compile

This builds the Java source code, as well as the SRILM wrapper. Similarly, 
if you have changes to the code, you can rebuild the decoder using the same 
command.

For a full rebuild of the decoder, simply run

$ ant clean

before building. This command will remove any previously compiled code.



 -------------------------------
| Testing Joshua               |
 -------------------------------

To run the Joshua unit tests:

$ ant test


To run the example:

$ ./example/decode_example_javalm.sh

or

$ ./example/decode_example_srilm.sh



 -------------------------------
| Packaging Joshua (optional)  |
 -------------------------------

To pack the decoder into a JAR archive, 
either compiled or the source code, run

$ ant jar

or

$ ant source-jar



 --------------------------
| Extract a sample grammar |
 --------------------------

$ java -cp bin joshua.sarray.ExtractRules --source=data/europarl.es.small.100 --target=data/europarl.en.small.100 --alignments=data/es_en_europarl_alignments.txt.small.100 --test=data/europarl.es.small.1 --maxPhraseLength=5
